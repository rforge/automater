#################################################################

#The library site-library-fresh-notdevel (packages defined by  FRESH and not 
#in DEVEL) are for the purpose of R package development at your own site. 
#These will not be used by normal users. 
#This library has packages needed for development but not actually 
#being developed. (The logic of this is to reduce the possibility 
#of accidentally testing with old versions of development packages that
#have been installed in site-library or site-library-fresh.)
#
#The packages in  site-library-fresh-notdevel are updated along with 
#site-library-fresh using target
#  make freshPlus 

#####         cron job Configuration     
# Target site-library-fresh-notdevel can be done along with fresh using
#    make freshPlus
# There is no target testfreshPlus since testfresh will test everything and the
# main purpose of site-library-fresh-notdevel is to omit some packages (the ones
# under development). A typical cron job might be 
# m h * * * (cd RoboAdmin ; ./getDates ;
#   make             >cron.out 2>&1 ; 
#   make freshPlus  >>cron.out 2>&1 ; 
#   make testsite   >>cron.out 2>&1 ; 
#   make testfresh  >>cron.out 2>&1)  || 
#   echo "Error occurred.  See $HOME/RoboAdmin/cron.out for details" 
# (all on one line)
