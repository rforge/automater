This Makefile based system does not install R. It is intended for running 
regular (automatic) tests when the tests themselves, or the packages they 
depend on, are updated. 

It uses an already installed R version (eg, from RoboAdmin), the location of
which should be given as an argument to configure.

Note: The RoboTests subdirectory names may correspond to an R package name, 
in which case the tests would typically be tests for that package.
The tests could come from the tests/ directory for the package, but might not. 
Directories BB and EvalEst provide examples of pulling tests automatically 
the from R-forge source tar.gz for packages. 
Directory TSMySQL provides an example of pulling tests automatically 
from the R-forge svn archive for a package. 
Both of these examples use tests from the package itself, but that is not
necessary.
