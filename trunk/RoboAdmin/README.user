##########  R USER NOTES ##########

R versions in this directory are installed approximately when the R version is 
released.  A specific R version can be used by setting, for example,

   export RHOME=/path/to/RoboAdmin/R-2.13.2/
   export PATH=$RHOME/bin:$PATH

or in csh    
   setenv RHOME /path/to/RoboAdmin/R-2.13.2/
   set path=($RHOME/bin $path )

where /path/to/RoboAdmin needs to be set to the location where RoboAdmin has
been installed on your system.

The install process sends email notification to users when a new version has
been install. To be added to the list you should contact the person who set 
up this process on you system.

The R recommended packages, which are distributed automatically with R, are 
installed in the library directory of the distribution and not updated. (You 
will get a newer library with a newer version of R.) This library is available
by default.

### site-library ###
Other R packages, from CRAN and other repositories, are installed in the 
site-library directory of the distribution and not updated.  (You will get a 
newer site-library with a newer version of R.) This site-library is
also available by default. 

### site-library-fresh ###
Some (possibly packages in the site-library list) R packages, from CRAN and 
other repositories, are installed in the site-library-fresh directory of the 
distribution.  These will be updated from 
time-to-time, so you cannot be guaranteed the version of a package is the same 
as the last time you used the library. Generally, this library will only be
updated for the most recent version of R. You will not have access
to this library by default, but can access it by specifying, for example,
  
  export R_LIBS_SITE=$RHOME/site-library-fresh/
or 
  export R_LIBS_SITE=$RHOME/site-library-fresh/:$RHOME/site-library/

The second will cause R to look first in site-library-fresh and then in 
site-library, using the first place a specified package is found.


### site-library-devel site-library-fresh-notdevel###

These libraries are for onsite package development. 
See README.admin for more details.



##########  R VERSION NOTES ##########

The R build is done on a specific system and may work on similar systems that
mount the file system in a network environment, but may not work on sytems
with a different OS. This can be of concern
when the OS is being upgraded, and some machines have different versions than 
others.  The most recent version of R will typically be built on a newer
operating system (and it is sometimes difficult to build it on an old OS).
Don't expect to get a new R on an old OS, or an old R on a new OS.


##########  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ##########

See the file README.admin (and the Makefile for details).
