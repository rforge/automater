****************  KNOWN BUGS   ****************

The fetching of the tarball uses R-latestest.tar.gz which will be R-patched
after the new R is released. Make recognizes this and stops, but there is not
yet a mechanism to stop before the tarball is downloaded. To prevent this extra
netork traffic the cron job should be removed until it is again needed.

If there is a change in base R or recommended packages that affects the output
of a test (e.g. a new or different note from the methods package) then the
different output will cause a test to fail. To update the output to be used
for comparison change the file 
   /path/to/RoboAdmin/tests/whichever/whichever.Rout.save
but note that this will then cause testing in RoboAdmin (testfresh) to fail
until the new R release.

****************  DESCRIPTION  ****************

This Makefile based system installs R release candidates and runs tests 
from the RoboAdmin direcory. The location of that directory should be passed as
an argument to configure:

./configure   /path/to/RoboAdmin

The /path/to/RoboAdmin is used to set variable ROBOADMIN in Makevars, and this
is used to determine where tests/ files should be >copied< from. Beware that
these files are copied every time the testing is done, so changes in the
RoboAdmin test files will be incorporated in the RC testing next time it is run,
and changes in the corresponding RoboRC/tests/RoboAdmin/tests/* directory
will be >lost<.

Note also that only site-library/ is installed (as done by RoboAdmin) but this
is installed with the latest packages, so is more like site-library-fresh/. 
Thus make in RoboRC/tests only does "make testsite" in the subdirectories. 
If you run make default in the subdirectories, this will look for 
site-library-fresh/ and fail.

The testing can be run automatically with a crontab entry like

0 2 * * * (cd RoboRC ; ./getPreRelDates ; make >cron.out 2>&1 ) || echo "Error occurred. See $HOME/RoboRC/cron.out for details"
which would run at 2am local time.

This downloads and compiles the latest beta or RC version of R from CRAN (in 
R-test) and then changes into the tests directory and runs make there.

The script getPreRelDates sets file time stamps to the beginning of the day
of the release (i.e. time 00:00). If it is run in the late evening in a time
zone to the west of CRAN (Austria), and next day's release has already happened,
this has the result that the file time stamp is set in the future. Make then
complains:

  File `R-src/latestdt' has modification time ... s in the future

and fails to build the new R. This can be avoided by running the cron job in 
the early morning rather than late evening.
