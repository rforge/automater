****************  KNOWN BUGS   ****************

The fetching of the tarball uses R-latestest.tar.gz which will be R-patched
after the new R is released. Make recognizes this and stops, but there is not
yet a mechanism to stop before the tarball is downloaded. To prevent this extra
netork traffic the cron job should be removed until it is again needed.

****************  DESCRIPTION  ****************

This Makefile based system installs R release candidates and runs tests 
from the RoboAdmin direcory. The location of that directory should be passed as
an argument to configure:

./configure   path/to/RoboAdmin

The testing can be run automatically with a crontab entry like

0 2 * * * (cd RoboRC ; ./getPreRelDates ; make >cron.out 2>&1 ) || echo "Error occurred. See $HOME/RoboRC/cron.out for details"
which would run at 2am local time.

This downloads and compiles the latest beta or RC version of R from CRAN (in 
R-test) and then changes into the tests directory and runs make there.

The script getPreRelDates sets file time stamps to the beginning of the day
of the release (i.e. time 00:00). If it is run in the late evening in a time
zone to the west of CRAN (Austria), and next day's release has already happened,
this has the result that the file time stamp is set in the future. Make then
complains:

  File `R-src/latestdt' has modification time ... s in the future

and fails to build the new R. This can be avoided by running the cron job in 
the early morning rather than late evening.
