<P>
<b>develMake</b> provides tools to support development of <i>R</i> packages.
The make files are used in a directory above R package directories. 
They facilitate testing and building of the packages. 
The system is especially helpful when there are dependency 
relationships among the packages.
<P>
See the README file in the top level directory for more details.

<b>develMake</b> is available by anonymous checkout from the code repository.
